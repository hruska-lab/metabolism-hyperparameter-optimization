AC50 = concentration at which 50% of maximum activity is observed
IC50;Ratio IC50;IC20;IC90;IC;IC5;Log IC50 = the mean inhibitory concentration value; e.g. how much of a particular inhibitory substance is needed to inhibit, a biological process by a certain percentage
Inhibition = an agent that slows or interferes with a chemical action
EC50 = the concentration of a drug that induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum
Potency = an expression of the activity of a drug in terms of the concentration or amount of the drug required to produce a defined effect
Activity = a measure of the physiological response that a drug produces
Ki = inhibitor constant, how potent an inhibitor is; it is the concentration required to produce half maximum inhibition
Drug metabolism
FC = the tail region of an antibody that interacts with cell surface receptors
Kinact;kinact = first-order rate constant that defines the maximum rate of enzyme inactivation
Kcat = the maximum number of substrate molecules which can be converted to products per molecule enzyme per unit time
Km = the Michaelis-Menten constant
Vmax = the maximum velocity of an enzymatically catalyzed reaction when the enzyme is saturated with its substrate
Vmax/Km = a measurement of catalytic efficiency
Ratio
T1/2;t1/2 = half-life, the time required for plasma concentration of a drug to decrease by 50%
K;Log 1/Km = the elimination rate constant, e.g. the rate at which a drug is removed from the human system
CL = clearance, it describes the relationship between concentration and the rate of elimination of drug from the body
Emax = efficacy, the maximum effect which can be expected from this drug
mechanism based inhibition = unreactive molecules that are transformed into an active species that inhibits the enzyme
Rate of oxidation
Delta Tm = the difference between the melting temperature for calf thymus DNA with drug and without drug
Kd;Kdiss = equilibrium dissociation constant, the inverse of the affinity of the drug for the receptor
pIC50 = the negative log of the IC50 value when converted to molar
Inhibitory index = an inverse measure of the potency of an antimetabolite
Vmax(app) = apparent Vmax
PPB = plasma protein binding
Imax = inhibitory maximum
Cmax = the maximum serum concentration thtat a drug achieves after administration
Drug uptake = a continuous process of passive influx of drug into the cytoplasm
Control of P-450 marker


is NOT a part of drug metabolism
Compound recovery = measured mass concentration of a target volatile organic compound in the air leaving the emission test chamber
INH = isonicotinic acid hydrazide, an antibiotic
TDI = tolerable daily intake
Stability = ability of a pharmaceutical product to retain its chemical, physical, microbiological and biopharmaceutical properties throughout its shelf-life
Retention_time = the primary means for chromatographic peak identification
Ks = kaposi sarcoma, a cancer that develops from the cells that line lymph or blood vessels
Partition ratio = the ratio between un-ionized drug distributed between the organic and aqueous layers at equilibrium
NOAEL = the highest dose where the effects observed in the treated group do not imply an adverse effect to the subject
CL free
